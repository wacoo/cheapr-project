Cheapr Project

Cheapr is a revolutionary app that makes it easy to find nearby stores and service providers offering the best deals on quality goods and services. What's more, it supports businesses that offer the most affordable prices by promoting them to users. The main goal of this project is to encourage a fair price for the goods or services provided. 
Designed, programmed, and tested by Wondmagegn Abriham Chosha, Cheapr offers a user-friendly web interface and RESTful API, making it accessible through any mobile device or other interfaces. 
The target audience for this project are those with low to medium incomes as even the slightest reduction in prices can have a significant impact on their daily lives.
